Info required
*latitude & Longitude of telescope
*time
*Locations of no go zone moved by controller
	*Given in ra and dec
	*
*Is there a counter-weight
*Which side of the mount is the telescope on
 



Method
Take a picture of the sky
Feed picture to the sky to astrometry program / api
Wait for solve

If Solve
	Get ra_center and dec_center
	Convert to alt and azimuth
	Get RA and DEC of several stars used to solve
		Comes from astrometry.net\api
	Convert to alt and azimuth
	get pixel location of stars used to solve
		Comes from api 
	coordinate conversians to the same coordinate system 
	Overlay the two pictures 
	Calculate the angle between the two
	That angle is relavtive to the position
	
If no Solve
	Sky is unclear don't use telescope
	



** To Do **
1)Build something to test if an arbitrliy oriendted cylinder of length L and radius R intersects with a cone of 
height H and slope A
	1.1) Intersect with Cylinder
	1.2) Intersect 

2)Set up a way to convert Ra and Dec or alt az to the orientation of the cylinder 

3)Create a path from A to B where the cylinder keeps a minimum distance D from the cone

4)Communicate with astrometry.net api
	4.1)Upload a Picture
	4.2)Check Status
	4.3)Get the Alt AZ
	4.4)Get specific Stars
	4.5)Get alt az of specific stars

5)Be able to setup
